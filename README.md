BrewBud
=======

BrewBud is a 'all things beer' tracking system. 
BeerDatabase: A database system to record information about your favorite beers and breweries.
BrewTracker: A monitoring system utilizing environmental data collection via sensor inputs. 
            Uses a raspberry pi as monitor system attached to homebrew fermentation chambers to record temp ([future plans] co2, light intensity)
            BrewBud application will save these readings in database and serve this data in graph format 
            to user when accessed through gui. 

Currently in pre-development stage so may be very unstable.
